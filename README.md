## [Bellabeat_Case_Study](https://github.com/MaximeEme/Bellabeat_Case_Study) 

Case study to complete the Google/ Coursera Data Analytics Professional Certificate using real life data to answer the business question : Analyse smart data usage from fitbit users to discover trends and apply them to the Bellabeat marketing team. It has been done using R studio.

### Recommendations :

I would encourage Bellabeat to continue their trend searching and to extend their datasets to be able to find more noticeable trends and have better results.

1/ After I classified the users in four categories (sedentary, lightly active, fairly active and very active), I noticed than the average user was very active (i.e walk more that 7500 steps). We can encourage that behavior by sending notifications and alarm if the user hasn't reached its goal.

2/ The results I got on sleep from the dataset could be improve by setting alarms on desired amount of sleep and maybe notification on the health benefits of a good night of sleep.

3/ Setting a reward system on reaching daily, monthly and quarterly goals. The rewards could go from a new background on the app to free-month subscription.

## [Cyclistic_Case_Study](https://github.com/MaximeEme/Cyclistic-bike-sharing)

Case study using data provided by Google during the Google/ Coursera Data Analytics Professional Certifcate. I have used data to answer the business question : Analyse historical trip data from Cyclist to identify trends and connections between casual riders and annual members. It has been done with R studio and Tableau.

### Recommendations :

Over the two-year period that I covered (2020/2022), they were more member than casual riders. The member preferred the docked bikes and the classic bike being close second than electrical bikes.

Member ride more during the week than casual member that ride mostly during the weekend, but casual member have a longer ride duration than member. It can be explained by the fact that member ride to commute to work or to go home while casual ride for leisure.

Member and casual riders ride more in the evening period, but member also ride a lot during the morning of the work week.

1/ Plan campaigns to promote the health benefits of using bike to commute to work and the environment benefits.

2/ Create an app that could track the activity of riders (i.e. calories burned or CO2 rejections prevented).

3/ Create partnership with local companies to promote the usage of bike through discount memberships or stations nearby.

4/ Increase bikes availability in the top 10 start stations.

### [Museum's visits in France](https://github.com/MaximeEme/Museums_visits_in_France/blob/main/README.md) 

Personal project produced during my free time. I have a passion about museums and wanted to explore interresting data. Data cleaning done on Gsheet and R studio. Analysis on R Studio. Visualizations on Tableau.

### Analysis 

1/ From 2008 to 2018, there's been a 4.7% decrease in museum's accreditation by the Ministry from 1219 museums in 2008 to 1161 in 2018. That represents 58 museums that disappeared from the Ministry's registry. The number of open museums has been stable during that 10 year period even though 21 museums closed doors, representing a 1.9% decrease.

2/ Museums have witnessed an important rise in visits either paid or free in those 10 years. Starting with the paid tickets, it represents a 50% increase in tickets sold between 2008 and 2018. 37% is the increase of free tickets from 2008 and 2018. It established France as a powerhouse of culture.

3/ Paris (75) is indeed the department with the most visitors while Haute-Loire (43) is the department with the least visitors.

4/ Musée du Louvre is the most visited museum in Paris, Ile-de-France and France and in both paid and free tickets. It is interesting to see that 6 regions have different museums in the two categories (Normandie, Pays de la Loire, PACA, Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, Grand Est, Centre-Val-de-Loire).

5/ Those 10 tens are not surprising. They represent each one a major city in France except Haut-Rhin (68) and Côte-d'or (21).

6/ Ile-de-France is dominating each and every region in terms of tickets in museums. The second is PACA with only 21 715 898 millions which is x6 less visitors than Ile-de-France and the third region with most visitors is Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes with 18 129 211 millions visitors.
